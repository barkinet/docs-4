title: Connecting Snyk to AWS Lambda
---
In order for Snyk to be able to monitor your deployed AWS Lambda functions, you'll first need to connect Snyk to your AWS Lambda account. You can do this by navigating to the [Integrations page](https://snyk.io/integrations) and clicking on "Connect to Connect to AWS Lambda".

This will take you to a page where you'll be prompted to enter your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
